# Sorting Algorithms in C++ Arrays

This repository is your one-stop shop for learning and practicing various sorting algorithms for arrays in C++. It provides clear explanations, code examples, and performance comparisons to help you choose the most suitable sorting method for your needs.

# Sections:

## Introduction : 

Define array sorting: Rearranging elements of an array in a specific order (ascending or descending).

Explain the importance of sorting in various applications (searching, data analysis, etc.).

## Sorting Techniques:

Explore different sorting algorithms with code implementations and complexity analysis (time and space):

Bubble Sort: Simple but inefficient method that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order. (Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1))

Selection Sort: Finds the minimum (or maximum) element and swaps it with the first (or last) element, repeating this process for the remaining elements. (Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1))

Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted sub-array at the beginning of the array, one by one inserting elements from the unsorted part into their correct positions in the sorted sub-array. (Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1))

Merge Sort: Divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts each sub-array recursively, and then merges the sorted sub-arrays back together in the correct order. (Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n) due to recursion)

Quick Sort: Picks a pivot element and partitions the array into sub-arrays of elements less than and greater than the pivot. Sorts both sub-arrays recursively and then combines them. (Time: O(n log n) on average,
O(n^2) in worst case, Space: O(log n) due to recursion)

## Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm :

factors to consider when selecting a sorting algorithm for your specific use case:

Array size: Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are inefficient for large arrays.

Data type: Counting sort or radix sort are efficient for sorting integers within a limited range.

Time vs. space complexity: Consider the trade-off between sorting speed and memory usage.
